# **Understanding the Binary Indexed Tree and Leftmost Building Queries**

---

## **Overview**
This document explains a solution for efficiently answering queries related to building heights. For a set of buildings with given heights and queries `(l, r)`, the goal is to determine the **leftmost index** of the building such that all preceding buildings in the range `[l, r]` are shorter or equal to the building at `r`.

## **Code**
### **Binary Indexed Tree Class**
```csharp
class BinaryIndexedTree {
    private readonly int inf = 1 << 30;
    private int n;
    private int[] c;

    public BinaryIndexedTree(int n) {
        this.n = n;
        c = new int[n + 1];
        Array.Fill(c, inf);
    }

    public void Update(int x, int v) {
        while (x <= n) {
            c[x] = Math.Min(c[x], v);
            x += x & -x;
        }
    }

    public int Query(int x) {
        int mi = inf;
        while (x > 0) {
            mi = Math.Min(mi, c[x]);
            x -= x & -x;
        }
        return mi == inf ? -1 : mi;
    }
}
```

### **Solution Class**
```csharp
class Solution {
    public int[] LeftmostBuildingQueries(int[] heights, int[][] queries) {
        int n = heights.Length;
        int m = queries.Length;

        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            if (queries[i][0] > queries[i][1]) {
                (queries[i][0], queries[i][1]) = (queries[i][1], queries[i][0]);
            }
        }

        int[] idx = Enumerable.Range(0, m).ToArray();
        Array.Sort(idx, (i, j) => queries[j][1].CompareTo(queries[i][1]));

        int[] s = (int[])heights.Clone();
        Array.Sort(s);

        int[] ans = new int[m];
        int j = n - 1;
        var tree = new BinaryIndexedTree(n);

        foreach (int i in idx) {
            int l = queries[i][0], r = queries[i][1];
            while (j > r) {
                int k = n - Array.BinarySearch(s, heights[j]) + 1;
                tree.Update(k, j);
                --j;
            }

            if (l == r || heights[l] < heights[r]) ans[i] = r;
            else {
                int k = n - Array.BinarySearch(s, heights[l]);
                ans[i] = tree.Query(k);
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
}
```

## **Explanation**

### **Binary Indexed Tree (BIT)**
- **Purpose:** A BIT is used to store and query data in logarithmic time.
- **Operations:**
  1. **Update:** Add or modify an index value efficiently.
  2. **Query:** Retrieve the smallest index of a building for a specific height range.

In this code, the BIT keeps track of the **smallest index** of buildings for various ranges of heights.

### **Solution Steps**

1. **Sorting Queries by Endpoint:**
   - Queries are sorted by their `r` value (right endpoint) to ensure processing is done in increasing order of range size.

2. **Cloning and Sorting Heights:**
   - The `heights` array is cloned and sorted to efficiently map building indices to height ranges.

3. **Processing Queries:**
   - For each query `(l, r)`:
     - If all buildings are shorter than or equal to the height at `r`, then `r` is the answer.
     - Otherwise, the BIT is used to determine the leftmost index where the condition fails.

4. **Binary Search and BIT Updates:**
   - Binary search maps a building's height to its corresponding range in the sorted array.
   - The BIT is updated with indices as we traverse the heights array.

## **Why This Approach?**

### **Pros:**
1. **Efficiency:** BIT reduces query and update times to \(O(\log n)\).
2. **Scalability:** Works well with large datasets due to logarithmic complexity.
3. **Modularity:** BIT operations are reusable for other problems.

### **Cons:**
1. **Complexity for Beginners:** Understanding and implementing BIT requires practice.
2. **Memory Usage:** Additional space is required for the BIT and sorted arrays.
3. **Edge Cases:** Special handling for cases like `l == r` is necessary.

## **Time and Space Complexity**

### **Time Complexity:**
1. **Sorting Heights and Queries:**
   - Heights: \(O(n \log n)
   - Queries: \(O(m \log m)\)

2. **BIT Operations:**
   - Updates and queries each take \(O(\log n)\).
   - Total: \(O((n + m) \log n)\).

**Overall:**
\[ O((n + m) \log n) \]

### **Space Complexity:**
- Arrays for heights, queries, and BIT: \(O(n)\).

---

## **Alternate Approaches**

### **Segment Tree:**
- **Pros:** Supports more complex range queries.
- **Cons:** Higher implementation complexity compared to BIT.

### **Brute Force:**
- Iterate over each query and calculate the result directly.
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n \times m)\).
- **Not Recommended** for large datasets.

### **Sparse Table:**
- Precomputes results for range queries.
- **Pros:** Extremely fast queries.
- **Cons:** Higher preprocessing cost.

---

## **Conclusion**
This implementation balances efficiency and complexity, making it a robust solution for the given problem. While BIT can be challenging to grasp initially, it is a powerful tool for range-based queries and updates.
