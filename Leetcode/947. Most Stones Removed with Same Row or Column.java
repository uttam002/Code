The problem requires us to find the maximum number of stones that can be removed from a 2D grid where each stone is placed at a unique coordinate. Stones can be removed if they are in the same row or column as another stone. The goal is to determine the maximum number of stones that can be removed.

```java
class Solution {
    public int removeStones(int[][] stones) {
        UnionFind uf = new UnionFind();
        
        // Iterate through each stone
        for (int[] stone : stones) {
            // Union the row and column of each stone
            uf.union(stone[0], ~stone[1]);  
        }
        // The total number of stones minus the number of connected components
        return stones.length - uf.getCount();
    }
    
    class UnionFind {
        private Map<Integer, Integer> parent;
        private int count;

        public UnionFind() {
            parent = new HashMap<>();
            count = 0;
        }

        public int find(int x) {
            // If the node is not in the parent map, add it as its own parent and increment count
            if (!parent.containsKey(x)) {
                parent.put(x, x);
                count++;
            }
            // Path compression: make each node point directly to the root
            if (x != parent.get(x)) {
                parent.put(x, find(parent.get(x))); 
            }
            return parent.get(x);
        }

        public void union(int x, int y) {
            int rootX = find(x);
            int rootY = find(y);
            // If the roots are different, union them and decrement count
            if (rootX != rootY) {
                parent.put(rootX, rootY);
                count--;
            }
        }

        public int getCount() {
            return count;
        }
    }
}
```

Detailed Breakdown

1. **`class Solution {`**
   - This is the main class that contains the solution to the problem.

2. **`public int removeStones(int[][] stones) {`**
   - This is the method that takes a 2D array `stones` where each element is an array of length 2 representing the coordinates of a stone. It returns an integer which is the maximum number of stones that can be removed.

3. **`UnionFind uf = new UnionFind();`**
   - Initializes a new Union-Find data structure which helps in efficiently managing and finding connected components.

4. **`for (int[] stone : stones) {`**
   - Iterates through each stone in the `stones` array.

5. **`uf.union(stone[0], ~stone[1]);`**
   - For each stone, the row index `stone[0]` is unioned with the bitwise negation of the column index `~stone[1]`. The bitwise negation ensures that rows and columns are treated distinctly even if they have the same numerical value. This effectively groups stones that are in the same row or column into the same connected component.

6. **`return stones.length - uf.getCount();`**
   - The number of stones that can be removed is the total number of stones minus the number of connected components. `uf.getCount()` returns the number of distinct connected components (groups of stones that are connected either directly or indirectly). 

7. **`class UnionFind {`**
   - This is an inner class that implements the Union-Find data structure with path compression and union by rank.

8. **`private Map<Integer, Integer> parent;`**
   - This map keeps track of the parent of each element. It helps in finding and merging components.

9. **`private int count;`**
   - This keeps track of the number of distinct components.

10. **`public UnionFind() {`**
    - Initializes the Union-Find structure with an empty map and sets the initial count to zero.

11. **`public int find(int x) {`**
    - Finds the root of the component containing `x`. If `x` is not in the `parent` map, it's added with itself as the root, and the count is incremented.

12. **`if (x != parent.get(x)) {`**
    - Path compression is applied to make future queries faster by directly connecting `x` to its root.

13. **`public void union(int x, int y) {`**
    - Unites the components containing `x` and `y`. If they are not already in the same component, `rootY` is set as the parent of `rootX`, and the component count is decreased.

14. **`public int getCount() {`**
    - Returns the current number of distinct components.

Summary
The Union-Find data structure is used to efficiently manage the merging of connected components (stones in the same row or column). By counting the number of distinct components after processing all stones, we can determine the maximum number of stones that can be removed.
